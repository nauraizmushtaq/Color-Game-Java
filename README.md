## Rules 

The	game	can	be	played	with	one	to	four	decks	of	cards,	once	this	is	decided;	the	total	decks	become	a	pile.		
1.Game	starts	by	shuffling	the	pile	and	each	player	is	given	one	card,	and	as	soon	as	any	player	gets	a	Jack	of	any	suit,	distribution	ends	and	the	player	with	the	jack	is	the	one	who	is	to	pick	any	suit	as	color	for	the	game.		
2. Pile	is	reset	and	shuffled	again	and	then	its	all	cards	are	distributed	equally	to	all	players.	Each	player	is	given	time	to	sort	cards	in	their	hand.		
3. First	turn	is	of	the	player	that	has	chosen	the	color.	He	has	to	dump	any	five	cards	of	his	choice	in	an	open	pile.	Others	players	have	to	dump	five	cards	too.		
4. After	that	each	player	can	pick	any	two	cards	from	this	open	pile	and	replace	them	with	any	cards	of	their	choice.	â€¢ Now	players	are	asked	to	show	their	hand.	The	winner	is	the	on
